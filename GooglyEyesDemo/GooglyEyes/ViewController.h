// Main view conroller for Googly Eyes, an app that uses the camera to track faces and
// superimpose Googly Eyes animated graphics over the eyes.
//
// The app supports both a front facing mode and a rear facing mode, which demonstrate different
// API functionality trade-offs:
//
// Front facing mode uses the device's front facing camera to track one user, in a "selfie" fashion.
// The settings for the face detector and its associated processing pipeline are set to optimize for
// the single face case, where the face is relatively large.  These factors allow the face detector
// to be faster and more responsive to quick motion.
//
// Rear facing mode uses the device's rear facing camera to track any number of faces.  The settings
// for the face detector and its associated processing pipeline support finding multiple faces, and
// attempt to find smaller faces in comparison to the front facing mode.  But since this requires
// more scanning at finer levels of detail, rear facing mode may not be as responsive as front
// facing mode.
